# ItemGlow
Required Plugin: https://modrinth.com/plugin/kotlinplugins
- Makes main hand and off-hand items glow when you keep sneaking.
- The glowing effect is Arrow Infinite 1 which provides advantage only if you hold bows.
- It doesn't affect items with other enchants and you can't switch items when you sneak so effect disappears.
- The purpose of this plugin is to improve cinematic and visual/pvp experience.
